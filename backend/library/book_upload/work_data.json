  "description": "Here is a novel, glamorous, ironical, compassionate \u2013 a marvelous fusion into unity of the curious incongruities of the life of the period \u2013 which reveals a hero like no other \u2013 one who could live at no other time and in no other place. But he will live as a character, we surmise, as long as the memory of any reader lasts.\r\n\r\n\"There was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life.... It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the story of this Jay Gatsby who came so mysteriously to West Egg, of his sumptuous entertainments, and of his love for Daisy Buchanan \u2013 a story that ranges from pure lyrical beauty to sheer brutal realism, and is infused with a sense of the strangeness of human circumstance in a heedless universe.\r\n\r\nIt is a magical, living book, blended of irony, romance, and mysticism.\r\n\r\n--first edition jacket\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [The Fitzgerald Reader](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL468551W/The_Fitzgerald_Reader)\r\n - [Three Novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald ](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL468557W)",
