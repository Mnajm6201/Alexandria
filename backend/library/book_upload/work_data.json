  "description": "Now in development for TV!\r\n\r\nSince its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time\u00ae by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters.\r\n\r\nThe Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, gleemen have told the tales of The Great Hunt of the Horn. So many tales about each of th Hunters, and so many Hunters to tell of...Now the Horn itself is found: the Horn of Valere long thought only legend, the Horn which will raise the dead heroes of the ages. And it is stolen.\r\n\r\nTV series update: \"Sony will produce along with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures. Rafe Judkins is attached to write and executive produce.
